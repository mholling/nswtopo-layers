# nswtopo-layers â€“ Layers Repository for nswtopo

This repository holds layer definitions for the [*nswtopo*](https://github.com/mholling/nswtopo) mapping software. They work with *nswtopo* version 2, and were removed from that repository to allow them to be updated and maintained separately from the code-base.

See the [layers directory](layers) for more details on the contents of various layers.

## Current Status

Tasmanian map layers are presently (February 2019) removed while *nswtopo* version 2 is in beta, but will be re-instated for the final release.

# Installation

Install the layers with Ruby's built-in *gem* package manager:

```sh
$ gem install nswtopo-layers
```
